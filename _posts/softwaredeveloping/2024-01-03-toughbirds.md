The Basic level, set against a serene landscape with towering rocks and clear skies, is perfect for beginners. Here, players are introduced to the fundamental mechanics of the game. The number of pigs is few, and their speed is slow, allowing new players to ease into the gameplay.

### Level 2: Intermediate

The Intermediate level brings a lush green backdrop with denser vegetation. As the challenge heightens, players will notice an increase in both the number of pigs and their speed, requiring better timing and skill to navigate through.

### Level 3: Hard
