When I wrote this piece two years ago, it was crystal clear that this profession would undergo fundamental changes. Since then, this transformation has continued every single day, without exception.

LLMs arrived. Now every day on LinkedIn, X, Reddit, even most YouTube videos, the same debate keeps circulating: "Will software engineering end?"

The concept of vibe coding is constantly evolving, getting better every day, and naturally gaining massive traction. Maybe people genuinely don't want such a profession to exist. The idea of a profession dying or surviving always attracts attention.

When LLMs first started writing code, before agentic IDEs existed, there was a common perception among seniors, team leads, and CEOs: "Writing code with LLMs is taking shortcuts because you don't know the syntax."

But the real masters built entire applications, entire products through pure vibe coding. My first was in 2019, the other in 2023.

One thing was clear: coding was enjoyable. Solving mental problems developed mathematical thinking and changed perspectives.

But the syntax memorization part always felt unnecessary to me from my very first day learning to code. Because when a new version comes out, even the syntax changes in programming languages. And if you're someone who develops projects in every field, goes deep in one area while loving to build products in others — how many languages' syntax can you really maintain at a good level?

## Vibe Coding and Software Engineering

This is where a structure emerged that allows everyone from 7 to 70 to build products: vibe coders and software engineering became intertwined.

This is usually brushed aside with sentences meant to comfort certain groups. But there's a topic being overlooked that carries serious time and money costs: yes, a person can build things. That's true.

But even in the simplest project, in this era of LLMs, the percentage of people who won't be able to scale that project is still around 95%. Because skills don't work in 1s and 0s. There's a spectrum. Some are at level 3, some at 7, some at 10.

And I can say this clearly: working with someone at level 7 is what every founder, every team leader genuinely wants.

## Two Profiles

### Profile A — Skill Level: 2

This person depends on approval. They can't foresee what problems their work will cause in the future. They do a task just to do it. Benchmarks, A/B tests, optimization don't matter to them. They don't question usability. "It works" is enough for them.

### Profile B — Skill Level: 7

This person anticipates potential problems without waiting for approval. They don't just do the work, they know why they did it that way. They evaluate alternative approaches, test, optimize. They question user experience. "It works" isn't enough. They think holistically from product to engineering, from end-user data to optimization. "How will this feature be used? What does the user data tell us? How can we build something better with this data?" They constantly ask these questions. They don't just write code, they make the product breathe.

## So Is Software Engineering Dead?

For people who cost more time and money? Yes. It's dead. In fact, it keeps dying every day.

Because today, a "software engineer" who can only write code, doesn't question why they're doing what they're doing, doesn't think about scale, maintenance, users, or data — is now becoming an expensive mistake.
