# Introduction to NumPy and Pandas with a Simple Example

Python is a powerful language for data analysis, and two of its most popular libraries for this purpose are NumPy and Pandas. Here's a simple example to demonstrate how these libraries can be used and their key differences.

## Python Standard Approach

Let's start with a basic Python function that sums and counts the odd numbers in a list:

```python
def sum_and_count_odds(numbers):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 != 0:
            total += num
            count += 1
    return total, count

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total, count = sum_and_count_odds(numbers)
print("Total:", total, "Number of Odd Numbers:", count)
```
## Using NumPy

Now, let's see how we can accomplish the same task using NumPy:

```python

import numpy as np

def sum_and_count_odds_numpy(numbers):
    numbers_np = np.array(numbers)
    odd_numbers = numbers_np[numbers_np % 2 != 0]
    total = odd_numbers.sum()
    count = odd_numbers.size
    return total, count

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total, count = sum_and_count_odds_numpy(numbers)
print("Total:", total, "Number of Odd Numbers:", count)

```



## Using Pandas

Finally, here's how Pandas can be used for the same purpose:

```python
import pandas as pd

def sum_and_count_odds_pandas(numbers):
    numbers_series = pd.Series(numbers)
    odd_numbers = numbers_series[numbers_series % 2 != 0]
    total = odd_numbers.sum()
    count = odd_numbers.count()
    return total, count

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total, count = sum_and_count_odds_pandas(numbers)
print("Total:", total, "Number of Odd Numbers:", count)
```

## NumPy

**Main Usage Area**: A library optimized for numerical calculations and mathematical operations.

**Data Structures**: The primary data structure is the homogeneous (containing data of the same type) multi-dimensional array (ndarray).

**Performance**: Performs high-performance operations on large datasets. Works faster than loops thanks to vectorized operations.

**Applications**: Ideal for lower-level mathematical and scientific calculations such as linear algebra, Fourier transformation, and random number generation.

## Pandas

**Main Usage Area**: A library designed for data analysis and manipulation.

**Data Structures**: There are two main data structures: DataFrame and Series. DataFrame holds heterogeneous data (data of different types) in a tabular form.

**Performance**: Offers good performance with large datasets, but is generally not as fast as NumPy.

**Applications**: More suitable for data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. Preferred for operations like SQL-like querying, handling missing data, grouping, and time series analysis.




## Key Differences Between NumPy and Pandas

- **Data Type and Structure**: NumPy is best suited for numerical computations on homogeneous data, while Pandas is designed for data manipulation and analysis on heterogeneous data.
- **Dimensionality**: NumPy primarily operates on multi-dimensional arrays, whereas Pandas works with two-dimensional data structures like DataFrames.
- **Analytical Tools**: Pandas offers a broader range of tools for data analysis, such as handling missing data, data alignment, and SQL-like operations, which are not inherently part of NumPy.
- **Performance**: For large datasets, NumPy is generally more efficient than Pandas for numerical computations.

Both libraries are integral to data analysis in Python and are often used together, leveraging their strengths in different scenarios.
