Neural networks have been a foundational piece of the artificial intelligence puzzle since their conception. Below is a timeline highlighting the development of various neural network architectures over the years.

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Foundations: 1940s and 1950s.

## Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN)
- Development: 1950s and 1960s.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Development: Late 1980s, early 1990s.

## Siamese Neural Networks (SNN)
- Development: Late 1990s.

## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Development: 1997.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Development: 1990s, especially after AlexNet won the ImageNet competition in 2012.

## Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
- Development: 2014.

## Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNet)
- Development: 2017.

## Region with Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN)
- Development: Early 2010s. (R-CNN and its derivatives emerged in the early 2010s, but specifying a particular year is challenging; generally considered the early 2010s.)
