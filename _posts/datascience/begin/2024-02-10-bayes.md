## Naive Bayes Classifier Types

A brief overview of different types of Naive Bayes classifiers and their applications:

| Type | Feature Distribution | Common Usage | Example Applications |
|------|----------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Multinomial Naive Bayes** | Counts of features (e.g., word counts in text) | Text classification | Email spam detection, document categorization |
| **Gaussian Naive Bayes** | Assumes features have a normal distribution | Continuous data | Disease classification from medical tests, weather prediction |
| **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** | Binary (Boolean) features | Binary data classification | Spam detection based on presence/absence of keywords |

### Usage Notes
- **Multinomial NB** is best for data where feature frequency matters, such as in document classification.
- **Gaussian NB** is suited for modeling features with a normal distribution, typical in many scientific applications.
- **Bernoulli NB** effectively handles binary/categorical data, especially useful in text processing where binary occurrence (yes/no) is analyzed.
