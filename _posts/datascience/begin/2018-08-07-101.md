In the U.S. university system, the term "101" typically refers to the basic, introductory level course of a discipline or subject. This term emerged as part of the university course numbering system, where the number "101" is commonly assigned to an introductory course in any given field. Initially, a course starting with "1" indicates that it is suitable for first-year (freshman) students, the "0" denotes a moderate level of difficulty, and the final "1" signifies that it is the first course in the sequence. Therefore, "101" courses are usually aimed at students who have no prior knowledge of the subject.
