The Setup
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import time

# Create a DataFrame with random data
np.random.seed(0)
data = {
    'A': np.random.randint(0, 100, 10000),
    'B': np.random.randint(0, 100, 10000),
    'C': np.random.randint(0, 100, 10000)
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

Comparing Two Methods
```python
start_time = time.time()

new_column = []
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    new_column.append(row['A'] + row['B'] - row['C'])

df['D'] = new_column

print("Slow Method Time:", time.time() - start_time)

```

|Output                        | 
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------|
| Slow Method Time:            |0.3220863342285156| 




Fast Method
Comparing Two Methods
```python
start_time = time.time()

df['D'] = df['A'] + df['B'] - df['C']

print("Fast Method Time:", time.time() - start_time)


```



|Output                        | 
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------|
| Fast Method Time:            | 0.00170135498046875| 



### Explanation and Expected Outcomes

1. **Setup**: We create a simulated DataFrame similar to your original code, but with simplified data for easy understanding.

2. **Original Method**: This section demonstrates your initial approach, where you add rows to the DataFrame using `.append()` inside a loop. This method is typically slower due to DataFrame rebuilding with each addition.

3. **Optimized Method**: Instead of appending each row directly to the DataFrame, we accumulate data in a list and then convert it to a DataFrame in one go. This method is generally much faster as it avoids the overhead of rebuilding the DataFrame for each row.

By running both methods and measuring the time taken, readers can clearly see the performance difference. The optimized method is expected to be significantly faster, especially with larger datasets, demonstrating the importance of efficient data manipulation techniques in Python.

This example can serve as an effective teaching tool on your blog, highlighting both the concept and its practical impact.
