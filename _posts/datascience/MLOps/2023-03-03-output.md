Understanding and evaluating machine learning models are crucial in applications like credit scoring or customer segmentation. In this tutorial, we'll explore a machine learning model designed to predict credit scores or identify potential customers, using a structured step-by-step approach.

### Scenario: Credit Score Prediction or Customer Segmentation

#### Step 1: Data Preparation

**Training Set**: Our dataset includes file numbers, customer features, and credit scores (or potential customer information) used to train the model. This data helps the model to identify patterns and relationships necessary for learning.

**Test Set**: We use this to test the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data, comprising file numbers and customer features for prediction.

#### Step 2: Model Training and Prediction

The model is trained with the training set data and subsequently makes predictions about the customers in the test set regarding their credit scores or potential customer status, based on the learned patterns.

#### Step 3: Accuracy Evaluation

To determine the model's accuracy, we compare its predicted values against the actual outcomes in the test set. This comparison sheds light on the model's effectiveness.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample test set predictions and actual values
data = {
    'file_number': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106],
    'actual_value': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    'predicted_value': [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Filtering correct predictions
correct_predictions = df[df['actual_value'] == df['predicted_value']]

# Listing file numbers of correctly predicted instances
correct_file_numbers = correct_predictions['file_number'].tolist()

print("Correctly Predicted File Numbers (Both '1' and '0'):", correct_file_numbers)
```

Correctly Predicted File Numbers  (Both '1' and '0') :**[101, 103, 104, 106]**
## Output Tables:

|    |   file_number |   actual_value |   predicted_value |
|----|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
|  0 |           101 |              1 |                 1 |
|  1 |           102 |              0 |                 1 |
|  2 |           103 |              1 |                 1 |
|  3 |           104 |              0 |                 0 |
|  4 |           105 |              1 |                 0 |
|  5 |           106 |              0 |                 0 |
